The following shaders implemented in this unity project are different types of illumination discussed: Simple Diffuse Lighting, Diffuse Lighting with Ambient and Simple Specular. 

Simple diffuse shader uses lambert reflection when light hit the 3d object. Diffuse lighting adds more ambient lighting and background lighting on the mesh, shadow areas are not pure black. Simple Specular shader adds reflective highlights on the mesh giving it shiny reflections.
